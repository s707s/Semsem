  <p>I've been <strong>MISSING</strong> for a while now..<br> The last time
    I've seen my owner was on , She misses me so much and, still thinks of me everyday
    she really hopes that someday she's going to see me and hug me and annoy me again..
    <br> I don't know if we'll ever meet again, I miss her too.. <br>
    if you ever see me anywhere even though i higly doupt it, but please if you do could
    you contact my stupid owner?.. <br> she'd probably reward you for it.. <br> anyways
